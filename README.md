# **Improved Inverse Q-Learning (IQ-Learn)**  

This is an **improved version** of [IQ-Learn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12142), originally proposed in **NeurIPS 2021**.  
Our modifications include:  

- ‚úÖ **Added KL divergence and reward-based baselines**  
- ‚úÖ **Extended support for Gym Atari and MuJoCo environments**  
- ‚úÖ **Optimized training pipeline for better stability**

## **Introduction**  
IQ-Learn is a **state-of-the-art imitation learning framework** that directly learns soft Q-functions from expert data. Unlike traditional adversarial approaches (e.g., GAIL, AIRL), IQ-Learn provides a **simple, stable, and data-efficient alternative** for both offline and online imitation learning.  

### **Our Key Modifications**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduced **KL divergence** and **reward-based baselines** to improve performance.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Adapted the method for **Gym Atari and MuJoCo environments**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized the **training pipeline** for better efficiency and generalization.

## **Key Advantages**  

‚úîÔ∏è **Drop-in replacement for Behavior Cloning**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Non-adversarial online imitation learning (successor to GAIL & AIRL)**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Performs well with very sparse expert data**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Scales to complex environments (Atari, MuJoCo)**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Can recover reward functions from the environment**

#### if you can't use WANDB,then you may can use
```
$env:WANDB_MODE = "offline"
```
